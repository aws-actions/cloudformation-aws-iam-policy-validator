  ignore-finding:
    description: 'Allow validation failures to be ignored. Specify as a comma separated list of findings to be ignored. Can be individual finding codes (e.g. "PASS_ROLE_WITH_STAR_IN_RESOURCE"), a specific resource name (e.g. "MyResource"), or a combination of both separated by a period.(e.g. "MyResource.PASS_ROLE_WITH_STAR_IN_RESOURCE"). Names of finding codes may change in IAM Access Analyzer over time. Valid options: FINDING_CODE,RESOURCE_NAME,RESOURCE_NAME.FINDING_CODE'
  actions:
    description: 'List of comma-separated actions. Example format - ACTION,ACTION,ACTION. This attribute is considered and required when policy-check-type is "CHECK_ACCESS_NOT_GRANTED"'
  reference-policy:
    description: 'A JSON formatted file that specifies the path to the reference policy that is used for a permissions comparison. This attribute is considered and required when policy-check-type is "CHECK_NO_NEW_ACCESS"'
  reference-policy-type:
    description: 'The policy type associated with the IAM policy under analysis and the reference policy. Valid values: IDENTITY, RESOURCE. This attribute is considered and required when policy-check-type is "CHECK_NO_NEW_ACCESS"'
  treat-finding-type-as-blocking:
    description: 'Specify which finding types should be treated as blocking. Other finding types are treated as non blocking. If the tool detects any blocking finding types, it will exit with a non-zero exit code. If all findings are non blocking or there are no findings, the tool exits with an exit code of 0. Defaults to "ERROR" and "SECURITY_WARNING". Specify as a comma separated list of finding types that should be blocking. Pass "NONE" to ignore all findings. This attribute is considered only when policy-check-type is "VALIDATE_POLICY"'
  treat-findings-as-non-blocking:
    description: 'When not specified, the tool detects any findings, it will exit with a non-zero exit code. When specified, the tool exits with an exit code of 0. This attribute is considered only when policy-check-type is "CHECK_NO_NEW_ACCESS" or "CHECK_ACCESS_NOT_GRANTED"'
    default: "False"
  allow-external-principals:
    description: 'A comma separated list of external principals that should be ignored.
